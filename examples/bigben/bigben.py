# # Big Ben

# *A literate notebook by [Sasha Rush](http://www.rush-nlp.com)*

# [Big Ben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ben) is the most iconic clock face in the world.

# <img style="height:300px;width:300px;max-width:auto;" src="bigben.png">

# In this notebook, we are going to replicate the design of the clockface from first principles using the
# Chalk library. This project was done for fun without any knowledge of clockmaking or even the right
# terminology. It is meant mainly as an introduction programmatic 2D diagramming.

# Here is what it will look like when we are done.

# <img style="height:300px;width:300px;max-width:auto;" src="chalk_bigben.svg">

# ## Preliminary: Roman Numerals

from chalk import *
from colour import Color

# The whole diagram a simple color pallet of gold black and a bit of grey.

gold = Color("#E7D49C")
white = Color("#CCCCCC")
black = Color("black")
grey = Color("#444444")


# To begin, we will introduce some of the concepts of the Chalk library
# by mimicking the shape of the roman numberal I, V, and X.

# ![](part0.png)

# Chalk uses basic shapes to build up compositional diagrams. For instance here
# is a filled rectangle.

column = rectangle(1, 4).fill_color(black)
column

# Each diagram has style properties and an "envelope" that describes
# its boundaries. Envelopes are a bit complex, they roughly are the
# the bounding box of the diagram.

column.show_envelope()

# Next lets make a diamond with an inlay. To do this we use `+` to put a
# grey box on a black box.

diamond = rectangle(1, 1).fill_color(black) + rectangle(0.5, 0.5).fill_color(grey)
diamond

# The benefit of the envelope representation is that it behaves more
# intuitively under affine transformations like rotation.

diamond = diamond.rotate_by(1 / 8)
diamond.show_envelope()


# We can easily combine diagrams. To see what a combination will look
# like we can use the `show_beside` method. You give it a vector along
# which to combine.

column.show_beside(diamond, -unit_y)

# We can also update the envelope of diagrams before combination.
# For instance here we substitute a small envelope for overlap.

column = column.with_envelope(rectangle(1, 2.5))
column.show_beside(diamond, -unit_y)

# When stacking on top we can use the shortcut `/`. The function `center_xy` resets
# the center to the middle of the envelope.

i = ((column / diamond).beside(diamond, -unit_y)).center_xy()
i = i + rectangle(0.01, 4).line_color(grey)
i.show_envelope()

# We can also put diagrams next to each other using the `|` notation.

ii = i | i
ii

# We can similar create diagrams for the other roman numerals.
# The `align` functions also re-center diagrams.

v = rectangle(1.5, 1).fill_color(black).align_bl() + i.align_b()
v


# Changing the center allows us to use `+` which joins diagrams together at the origin.


v = (v.align_br() + i.align_b()).center_xy()
v


# Creating X is a bit harder. We use two transformations to help us out.
# Using `translate` helps us nudge diagrams away from the origin.


ddiamond = (diamond | diamond).translate(-0.5, 0)
ddiamond.show_origin()

# Using `shear` lets us create a center line with a diagonal slash.

mid = (
    rectangle(2, 0.5).fill_color(black) + rectangle(1.5, 0.1).fill_color(grey)
).shear_x(-0.2)
mid


# We can then combine these complex diagrams together.
column = column
x = ((column / ddiamond) + mid).beside(ddiamond, -unit_y).center_xy()
x


# Compositionality is fun. We can take these shapes and make numbers from 1-12.

numbers = [
    x | i | i,
    i,
    i | i,
    i | i | i,

    x,

# We can draw the main clock-face by moving each number to the edge, and then rotating it
# to its location. The `concat` combinator glues each of these together at the origin.

    [
        n.center_xy().scale(0.05).translate_by(-unit_y).rotate_by(-i / 12)

# ## Inner Pattern

# ![](part1.png)

# This inner patten is a bit more complex. We are going to need more than just
# simple shapes to draw it.

# To start, let us make a function for rotational symmetry.


def rot_cycle(d: Diagram, times: int) -> Diagram:
    "Rotate diagram around a circle."
    return concat(d.rotate_by(i / times) for i in range(times))


# To try it out, we make the inner pattern by making a circle and
# rotating it around 12 times.

    (1 / 12) / 2

# Now we want to trace a trail that looks like the inner patttern.
# There is no magic here, just a little geometry to guess the shapes.
# Vectors `unit_y` and `unit_x` are geometric helpers.

u45 = unit_x.rotate(-45)
u60 = unit_x.rotate(60)
diffy = abs(u45.y / u60.y)
diffx = diffy * abs(u60.x / u45.x)

# A `Trail` is a sequence of vectors drawn in order.
# Once you are done drawing one you can use `stroke` to
# make it a diagram. We start at the top left and draw
# downward.

fudge = 0.73
y = (
    Trail(
        [
            u45,
            diffy * u60,

y.show_origin()


# To draw the curve we use `arc_between` which
# connects two points with a specified radius.

curve = 0.5
under_arc = arc_between(-unit_x, 2 * -unit_y, curve).align_tr()
under_arc.show_origin()

# We then combine them to the right scale.

pattern.show_origin()

# And then use reflection to double the pattern.

# ## Outer Bands


# ![](part2.png)


# With the functions we have so far it is not so hard to do the rest of the main
# clock-face. The maink point worth noting is that we can build each part without
# needing to know the sizes of the others. This makes it easy to debug and update.


# The first band is two circles with a black dots. Nothing new.
